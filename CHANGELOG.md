# Changelog

All notable changes to AegisAI are documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Pre-commit hooks** — Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with repository hygiene hooks (trailing-whitespace, end-of-file-fixer, check-merge-conflict, check-yaml, check-json) and a local ESLint hook wrapping the existing frontend lint command.
- **LLM Guard Prompt Normalization** — Preprocessor layer (`normalizer.py`) to prevent Unicode, zero-width, and homoglyph bypasses:
  - Strips invisible format characters in Unicode `Cf` category (e.g. zero-width space, non-joiner, joiner)
  - Normalizes stylized font variations using NFKC compatibility normalization
  - Resolves Cyrillic and Greek homoglyphs to standard Latin equivalents via static mapping
  - Retains both `normalized_prompt` and `user_prompt` in orchestrator response
- Unit and integration tests for bypass payloads (`test_normalizer.py` and `test_guard.py`)

### Fixed
- **Frontend Theme** — Fixed dark mode flash of unstyled content (FOUC), eliminated duplicate CSS, fixed React state overwrite bugs, and improved system preference synchronization.
- **Documents API** — Validate `ai_system_id` ownership before creating documents so users cannot link documents to another user's AI system.

  - Prompt sanitizer (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH levels)
- `POST /api/v1/guard/scan` endpoint
- **RAG Intelligence module** — FAISS vector store + LangChain 0.2 retrieval chain

### Known Limitations (good first contributions!)

- Frontend pages for Guard and RAG not yet built
