"""
Risk Classification Explainer Engine

Converts a plain-text AI system description into a structured
RiskClassificationRequest by extracting keywords and mapping them
to EU AI Act risk factors — then enriches the result with
legal article references and plain-English explanations.

No external LLM or API required — pure Python, works offline.
